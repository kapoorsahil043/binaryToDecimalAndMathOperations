# binaryToDecimalAndRecursiveOperations
Convert binary to decimal and perform recursive operations


Eg. Convert binary (011000) to decimal number. It's value would be 28;
Now, perform below operations on decimal value (i.e 28), till it reaches to 0;

If decimal number is even then divide it with 2
If decimal number is even then substract it with 1;
